Bowling Lane Booking System

Introduction:

We have developed a bowling lane booking system which is designed in a manner that the 
customer can see available lanes, request for booking a lane, select the number of players and 
return their booked lane, when a game is over. 

Project Approach: 
The code is designed in a way that the customers can

1. See available lanes 

2. Request to book a lane, and $15 will be charged for each lane per hour 

3. Select the number of players and $5 will be charged per player

4. Return their booked lane when a game is over


The bowling lane booking system can

1. Display available lanes 

2. Take the requests of customers for lane 

3. Issue the bills to customers for their booked lane 

4. Update available lanes list once the game is over 

Here, by default we set five bowling lanes. So, five customers can book the lane in the system. 
Two classes are created in bowlinglane.ipynb: Customer class and Bowlinglane class.
